## redditstream-cli 

Redditstream-cli is a command line tool/interface for live streaming reddit comments from any subreddit. It updates automatically, pulling the latest comments and printing them into a nice columnar format for you to view. 

It is written in Python, utilizing the PRAW Reddit API.

Here is an example of three different redditstream-cli sessions running, serving the latest comments from r/politics, r/soccer, and r/technology.

If you want to help out with this project or have suggestions/requests for features let me know!

I eventually want to make it more interactive, to allow you to change the subreddit or filter out certain submissions. So far I would consider this the alpha version. 

Hope you like it!
